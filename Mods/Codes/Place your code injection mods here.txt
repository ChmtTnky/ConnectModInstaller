Make sure to place the entire folder for each mod here.
Files with the same name will be in each mod folder, so DO NOT mix them.
Your folder should look like:

ModName1
ModName2
ModName3
...

Each folder should have a mod.bin, variables.txt, and functions.txt file.
The program looks only at the immediate files in each folder, so make sure the files aren't in any subfolders.
If two mods edit the same code, the last one applied will take priority.
Please check the descriptions of the mods you install to make sure they are not incompatible.
The log will list out which mods were applied and which were ignored.
If you install the same mod twice, you WILL cause bugs, so always verify the integrity of your game files in Steam before installing any code mods.
