Each mod folder should have a set of folders inside, named by their type.
For example, a mod may have an Assets, Hex, and Codes folder inside itself.
If a mod folder does not have any of these *immediately* inside, it will not install.
The program will not check subfolders for the mod types, only the folders immediately in the main mod folder.
